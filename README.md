# Nano Reader
## this project's purpose is to attempt extraction for Nano Diver (ナノダイバー) [NPJH-50375]

- this is just some experimental phase for unpacking datas, and probably slightly unreliable.. hopefully i could update this for time to time..

- Small documentation images are available that should give you some contexts about the files that we interact...

- Program is available on the **Releases** section, in case you want to do somekind of dumping and do research on files.

repacking is not possible for the time being.
